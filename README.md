Description
This script performs a complete differential gene expression (DGE) analysis pipeline for tumor vs. normal samples using gene expression and annotation data.
It automates loading, cleaning, merging, and visualizing gene-level fold changes and chromosome distributions.
The script includes robust QC checks, visualization of DEGs by chromosome, and heatmaps/clustermaps for exploratory insights.

Input files required 
Sample_Information.tsv
Gene_Expression_Data.xlsx
Gene_Information.csv

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:
Library
Purpose
numpy
Numerical computations
     pandas
Data handling and manipulation
matplotlib
Data visualization
seaborn
Advanced plotting with aesthetic styles
openpyxl
Reading Excel (.xlsx) files
scikit-learn
Standardization for heatmap visualization (StandardScaler)

Install them via:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl scikit-learn

How to Run the Script
Step 1: Organize Your Files
Place the following files in the same directory as the script:
Sample_Information.tsv
Gene_Expression_Data.xlsx
Gene_Information.csv
assignment_3.py
Step 2: Run the Script
Run the script using Python
The script automatically:
Loads all required data.
Maps sample IDs to phenotypes (tumor/normal).
Computes average expression per probe.
Calculates fold change between tumor and normal groups.
Identifies DEGs (|fold change| > 5).
Merges DEGs with gene annotation data.
Generates QC visualizations (chromosome distribution, DEG trends, heatmaps).

Output Files and Visualizations
The script generates the following figures and outputs during execution:
Output Type
Description
Chromosome Histogram
Distribution of DEGs across chromosomes.
Stacked Bar Chart (Tumor vs Normal)
Chromosomal breakdown of DEGs by expression trend.
Percentage Bar Plot
Percentage of DEGs upregulated in tumor vs normal samples.
Heatmap
Scaled heatmap of top variable or DEG probes.
Clustermap
Hierarchical clustering of selected probes across samples.
QC Console Logs
Detailed step-by-step outputs verifying data integrity and summary metrics.

(Optional: You can modify the script to save these plots as .png files or export tables as .csv.)

Notes & Recommendations
Ensure that column names in all input files match exactly (Probe_ID, sample_id, etc.).
The fold-change threshold for DEG detection (|fold_change| > 5) can be changed in Step 7.
If no DEGs are detected, try lowering the threshold (e.g., |fold_change| > 2).
Chromosome-based visualizations require a valid chromosome column in Gene_Information.csv.

Example Output Summary (Console)
After a successful run, youâ€™ll see a summary like this:
FINAL SUMMARY & QC METRICS
-------------------------
Sample info shape: (30, 3)
Expression matrix shape: (50000, 30)
Gene info shape: (50000, 4)
Common probes used for analysis: 49875
DEGs (|FC|>5): 612
Top chromosomes with DEGs:
 1     84
 12    52
 X     39
DEG trend distribution:
 Tumor    340
 Normal   272


Files Created During Execution
By default, the script only produces visualizations and console outputs.
If you wish to save outputs, uncomment or add:
deg.to_csv("Differentially_Expressed_Genes.csv", index=True)
plt.savefig("DEG_Chromosome_Distribution.png")
This will save the DEG table and generated figures to your working directory.
